# fun_with_graph_cycles

## Description from Project
we are going to have 3 objectivesfor the program you are going to create utilizing an adjacency list to represent a graph:
- Objective #1 –Count the total number of cycles in the graph of any length.
- Objective #2 –If there are any cycles, output the longest cycle in the graph.
- Objective #3 –Starting from Node 1, Use BFS to tell me how many layers exist in the given graph.The root will be layer 0.

## To run
`python3 project2.py` on terminal, will output results from `input1.txt`
